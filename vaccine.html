                        1. Injection Site Reactions: It is common to experience pain, redness, or swelling at the
                        injection site. This reaction usually subsides within a few days and is considered a normal
                        response to the vaccine.

                    <p>
                        2. Fatigue: Some individuals have reported feeling tired or experiencing fatigue after receiving
                        the Pfizer vaccine. This is typically a temporary side effect and should resolve within a few
                        days.

                    <p>

                        Pfizer vaccine. This discomfort is generally mild and tends to resolve within a few days.

                        1. Lymphadenopathy: Lymphadenopathy is the medical term for lymph node swelling. Some people who
                        received the Moderna vaccination have complained of transient lymph node swelling, especially in
                        the arm where the vaccine was given. Usually, this adverse effect goes away on its own in a few
                        days.

                    <p>
                        2. Vomiting and Nausea: Although it is rare, some people have mentioned feeling sick after
                        receiving the Moderna vaccine. Typically, these symptoms are minor and go away on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Allergic Reactions: Although they are uncommon, allergic reactions to vaccines, including the
                        Moderna vaccine, are possible. Hives, itchiness, breathing issues, and swelling of the face,
                        lips, tongue, or throat are possible side effects for some people.

                        1. Blood Clots: In rare cases, individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have
                        developed blood clots, particularly in combination with low levels of platelets. These blood
                        clotting events are extremely rare but have been observed primarily in women under the age of
                        50.
                    <p>
                        2. Fatigue and Body Aches: Some individuals have reported experiencing fatigue and body aches
                        after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. These symptoms are typically mild and temporary,
                        resolving within a few days.

                    <p>
                        3. Injection Site Reactions: Similar to other vaccines, pain, redness, or swelling at the
                        injection site can occur with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. These local reactions are usually
                        mild and resolve on their own within a few days

                        injection site with Covishield. This reaction is typically mild and temporary, resolving within
                        a few days.
                    <p>
                        2. Flu-like Symptoms: Some individuals may experience flu-like symptoms after receiving the
                        Covishield vaccine. These symptoms can include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle or joint pain,
                        and general malaise. Most people find these symptoms to be mild and self-limiting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Allergic Reactions: While rare, allergic reactions to the Covishield vaccine can occur.
                        Symptoms may include hives, itching, swelling of the face or throat, difficulty breathing, or a
                        rapid heartbeat. If any signs of an allergic reaction are noticed, immediate medical attention
                        should be sought.

                        associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine is thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). It
                        involves the formation of blood clots in combination with low platelet levels.
                    <p>
                        2. Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Some individuals who received the AstraZeneca vaccine have
                        reported experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms. These can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
                        or abdominal pain.

                        3. Flu-like Symptoms: As with many vaccines, flu-like symptoms may occur after receiving the
                        AstraZeneca vaccine. These symptoms can include fever, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, and
                        general malaise.

                        experiencing an elevated heart rate or palpitations. While this side effect is rare, it should
                        be monitored and reported to healthcare professionals if it persists or becomes severe.
                    <p>
                        2. Allergic Skin Reactions: Allergic skin reactions, such as rashes or itching, have been
                        reported as potential side effects of the Sputnik V vaccine. These reactions are typically mild
                        and localized, resolving without complications in most cases.

                    <p>
                        3. Blood Clotting Disorders: In rare instances, the Sputnik V vaccine has been associated with
                        blood clotting disorders, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia.
